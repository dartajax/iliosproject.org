Like much of the country we were severely impacted by the massive DDoS attack on Dyn and the DNS upstream controls of the internet on Friday the 21st. This left us unable to complete our regular code release that day (or get out our newsletter, or update this site!). However, with the babycam and toaster cyber-army in abeyance for the moment, we are pleased to announce the release today of Ilios __v3.21__. This is update reflects a number of significant improvements and enhancements to the system and the API, including:

- New, comprehensive view of course learning materials;
- Additional views into past learning materials for students;
- foundations for the new robust, configurable permissions model;
- the ability to clone Curriculum Inventory Reports from year to year;
- improvements and bug fixes for the CI toolset;
- a whole new raft of other housekeeping and under-the-hood bug fixes, code enhancements, and improvements to reduce navigation errors and improve performance and usability.

__AMAZON TIME__: If you are interested in hosting your Ilios instance on AWS, we now have a Ansible-deployed AWS-ready implementation of the Ilios code. Please [contact us](mailto:support@iliosproject.org?subject=AWS%20deployment%20inquiry){:target="_blank"} for more info.

__STUDENT SURVEYS__: Student use surveys were recently completed at both UFL and UCSF, and although I was hoping to share some of the results with you this week, I am still awaiting the finalized data from the UC survey. But I can tell you that generally speaking, the results are both positive and enlightening. With any luck we will have that for you next week.

__TRAINING__: Are you interested in getting a focused training for your power Ilios users and managers in your school or institution? We can do that for you: 1.5 - 2 days of focused training on the most effective ways to leverage Ilios as power users, and deliver information to your students and faculty in the best way possible, custom-tailored for your needs and methodologies. Please [contact us](mailto:support@iliosproject.org?subject=training%20inquiry){:target="_blank"} if you are interested.
